# Unitful.jl

Unitful is a Julia package for physical units. Available
[here](https://github.com/ajkeller34/Unitful.jl). Inspired by:

- [SIUnits.jl](https://github.com/keno/SIUnits.jl)
- [EngUnits.jl](https://github.com/dhoegh/EngUnits.jl)
- [Units.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Units.jl)

We want to support not only SI units but also any other unit system. We also
want to minimize or in some cases eliminate the run-time penalty of units.
There should be facilities for dimensional analysis. All of this should
integrate easily with the usual mathematical operations and collections that
are found in Julia base.
