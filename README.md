# Unitful.jl

A Julia package for physical units. Available
[here](https://github.com/ajkeller34/Unitful.jl). Inspired by Keno Fischer's
very clever package [SIUnits.jl](https://github.com/keno/SIUnits.jl).

We want to support not only SI units but also any other unit system. We also
want to minimize or in some cases eliminate the run-time penalty of units.
There should be facilities for dimensional analysis.
All of this should integrate easily with the usual mathematical operations
and collections that are found in Julia base.
